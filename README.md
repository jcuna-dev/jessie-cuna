## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a full-stack web developer from the Philippines with a strong focus on system design, performance, and clean user interfaces. I specialize in building real-world business systems such as clinic monitoring systems, inventory management platforms, and appointment portals.

**Philosophy:** Understanding the fundamentals comes before coding fast—which is why my approach always starts with proper architecture, clean data flow, and long-term scalability.
